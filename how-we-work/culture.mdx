## Transparency

We believe in great communication which is only possible with extreme transparency into the inner workings of Mintlify.

We strive to maintain transparency as we grow by continuing to provide perspective and insight into what we're working on. Employees should feel open to express their fears, uncertainties, and doubts. Your concerns will always be taken seriously without prejudice. We believe that this is the only way to build a great company and prevent problems from staying hidden.

## Speed

If given a choice, go live. If you can't go live, reduce the task size so you can.

- We are small, and can only win based on speed and agility.
- Going live forces a level of completion, on which you can build.

## 20:80
Always start with the 20:80 solution. Ask yourself "How can I do 20% of the work to get 80% of the value?". Be hacky. Be scrappy. Be creative. Be fast.

As we grow, we will encounter times when we need to build scalable systems. Even then, ask what's the 20% of scaling work we need now. We'll do the other 80% of the work over time.

## Autonomous

Everyone has the ability to make decisions without having to ask permission. We will regularly sync on the team's goals so you can feel confident in your choices.
