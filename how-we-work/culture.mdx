## Transparency
We believe in great communication which is only possible with extreme tranparency into the inner workings of the company.

We strive to maintain transparency through our growth and provide perspective and insight into what we're working on. Employees should feel open to express their fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), raise objections, and discuss concerns. We believe that this is the only way to build a great company and prevent problems from staying hidden in a small part of the company.

## Autonomous
Everyone works autonomously and has the ability to make decisions without having to ask permission.

## Speed

> If given a choice, go live. If you can't go live, reduce the task size so you can.
>
> - We are small, and can only win based on speed and agility.
> - Going live forces a level of completion, on which you can build.
